Creating a webhook in GitHub and Configuration

The next step is to create a webhook on GitHub. 
A webhook is a URL that GitHub uses when a new commit is pushed to the repository. 
This URL will initiate a build in Jenkins.

Jenkins can set up configurations either manually or automatically. 
Let’s look at how to manually set up configurations. 
To create a webhook manually, go to your GitHub repository, click Settings, and then Webhooks. 
Click on Add webhook and enter the Jenkins URL. The Jenkins URL should have the following format:

http://<jenkins_server>/github-webhook/

After you’ve configured the webhook, click Add webhook to save. 
Using the automatic mode, Jenkins will add/remove hook URLs from GitHub based on the project configuration in the background.
